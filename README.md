Use the Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API) to develop a simple Hacker
News (https://news.ycombinator.com) reader site. Your goal is to showcase your proficiency in
React development, including API integration, data rendering, and creating a user-friendly
interface.
Technical requirements:
● Develop a web application using React 16+ framework that consists of at least 2 pages:
○ Display a list of top items in descending order from the Hacker News API
(https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json). Demonstrate your
ability to efficiently fetch and integrate data using either the Fetch API or Axios.
○ Create a detailed item page that shows a list of comments and their replies for a
selected item. You can fetch the item's details using the Hacker News API, for
example: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/2921983.json?printpretty
. Display at least one level of nested comments (replies) to demonstrate your
understanding of data structure handling. For an added challenge, you're
encouraged to implement a solution that displays all available nested comments,
showcasing your ability to handle complex data structures effectively and provide
a comprehensive user experience.

Your solution should not only meet the technical requirements but also showcase good UI/UX
practices. While the example pages are provided as attachments for reference, feel free to
demonstrate your design skills by creating a user-friendly interface that enhances usability and
engagement. Pay attention to the design, layout, and responsiveness of the application to
ensure an optimal user experience.
